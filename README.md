# Translator Bot
This bot automatically translates between English and French and vice-versa. It was developed by [Bradley Wells](https://wellsb.com/csharp/) to demonstrate how to create a bot using C# and the Microsoft Bot Framework. It uses machine-learning translation provided by Azure Cognitive Services Translator API.
